    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h3 id="In-the-Beginning"><a href="#In-the-Beginning" class="headerlink" title="In the Beginning"></a>In the Beginning</h3><p>I started out playing with Wordpress a few years back, and didn’t really do a ton with it, mostly because I created a site with <a href="https://wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wordpress.com</a> and not <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wordpress.org</a>… rookie mistake on my part. What’s the difference? Dot com is more of a basic, watered-down version of Wordpress with limited features, where dot org sort of unlocks the full customization you can expect from just writing custom code from scratch.</p>
<h3 id="Why-Ditch-Wordpress"><a href="#Why-Ditch-Wordpress" class="headerlink" title="Why Ditch Wordpress?"></a>Why Ditch Wordpress?</h3><p>Well, a couple reasons. As a new developer, I really want to dig into the code part of my website and have a little more control over my website. Also, the first stack I ever learned used NodeJS and Express on the backend. Creating a blog that used pure JS on the backend seemed to make the most sense for me, and Hexo was a perfect fit. Wordpress is written with a ton of PHP, which I feel is going out of style (I very well could be wrong), and NodeJS is one of the more up-and-coming technologies out there. So I guess that makes me a hipster noobie dev.</p>
<h3 id="Installing-Hexo"><a href="#Installing-Hexo" class="headerlink" title="Installing Hexo"></a>Installing Hexo</h3><p>The install was actually super easy. One line in the terminal to get the basics installed:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">sudo npm install hexo-cli -g --save</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>And one more to create an instant blog:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">hexo init</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>Once you have that set up, you can either edit or delete the default “Hello World” post, and add images by dropping them into an asset folder for that post. Other things like videos, quotes, and code snippets can be added with some special markdown found <a href="https://hexo.io/docs/tag-plugins.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Once you’ve got your first post written, you’re pretty much done! The only thing left is to use your markdown file and asset folder to actually generate an HTML blog post. To do that, it’s literally:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">hexo generate</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>That will create a new folder in your project directory called “Public”. That’s it! Just grab the contents of your public folder and toss it on your server. You can also set up your own deployment methods over <a href="https://hexo.io/docs/deployment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">hexo deploy</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>

        <h3 id="Outgrowing-Chrome-OS"><a href="#Outgrowing-Chrome-OS" class="headerlink" title="Outgrowing Chrome OS"></a>Outgrowing Chrome OS</h3><p>It wasn’t too long ago that made the decision to see what I could do about stretching the capabilities of my Chromebook 14. It was my first exposure to Chrome OS, and it was fine, but I quickly realized there were a few limitations to the OS. Basically, if it’s not in the Google Play store, it ain’t gonna happen. Luckily, with the state of the web in 2017, there were a few browser-based workarounds to getting stuff done like Cloud 9 IDE for developing (which I still use), and <a href="https://pixlr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pixlr.com</a> for simple, quick photo edits. I was willing to deal with it for a bit and find little Chrome-based workarounds here and there. But eventually, after a few months, I hit the wall. There were absolutely no practical FTP solutions, no email clients, no true file system (Google Drive breaks down after a certain point) and no browser options outside of Chrome. So I decided to check out other options. Enter Ubuntu 17.10 Artful Aardvark.</p>
<img src="/2017/12/10/How-Unscrewing-My-Chromebook-Unlocked-Its-Full-Potential/ubuntu-17.10-desktop.jpg" title="The Ubuntu 17.10 desktop">
<h3 id="First-Attempt"><a href="#First-Attempt" class="headerlink" title="First Attempt"></a>First Attempt</h3><p>First off, I created my Ubuntu boot stick. But ChromeOS is not your typical OS in almost every way. You can’t just pop in a USB stick and hold a combination of keys to bring up your BIOS boot priority. Fist, much like jailbreaking a phone, you have to crack into developer mode, which consists of holding ESC + Reload(F3) + Power. This boots into recovery mode and tells you your OS is missing or damaged.</p>
<img src="/2017/12/10/How-Unscrewing-My-Chromebook-Unlocked-Its-Full-Potential/missingOS.jpg" title="Your OS is missing! (Not really)">
<p>Once you see this screen, you have to hit CTRL + D to disable OS verification (yes, by default, Chrombooks reject operating systems that aren’t Google)</p>
<img src="/2017/12/10/How-Unscrewing-My-Chromebook-Unlocked-Its-Full-Potential/OSveroff.jpg" title="OS verification is turned OFF">
<p>Once your OS verification is disabled, you should be good to go… Kinda. Now that you’re in developer mode, you can open a browser-based terminal by hitting CTRL+ALT+T. From there, you’ll need to gain access to your BIOS, which Google keeps loked up pretty tight, even for those in developer mode. Luckily, <a href="https://mrchromebox.tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mr. Chromebox</a> has a pretty killer fix. For my particular machine, I had to enable Legacy Boot Mode and install <a href="https://www.seabios.org/SeaBIOS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SeaBIOS</a> before I could boot to my USB and start the Ubuntu 17.10 install. Good news, it worked! Kinda… Install ran great, but the system was kinda laggy, and because the sound card is completely separated from the main motherboard… I couldn’t get sound working. Even after several tries, running…<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">sudo apt-get install</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><br>and…</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">sudo apt-get update</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>No dice, and no audio either.</p>
<h3 id="Second-Attempt"><a href="#Second-Attempt" class="headerlink" title="Second Attempt"></a>Second Attempt</h3><p>Having already come this far, I wasn’t ready to go back to Chrome, so I started looking at other Linux distros. Enter <a href="https://galliumos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GalliumOS</a>. I created a new boot stick with Gallium, plugged it in, ran the install, but this time, before running the install, I popped the panel off the back of my machine and removed the two write-protect screws. Ran the install, and boom. My machine handled better, and lots of features just worked out-of-the-box. After the install had completed, I just plugged the screws right back in and buttoned up the back panel. It was like getting a brand new computer.</p>
<img src="/2017/12/10/How-Unscrewing-My-Chromebook-Unlocked-Its-Full-Potential/desktop.png" title="Default Gallium OS desktop">
<p>My audio problem was fixed, and after just a click or two, DRM playback was enabled so I could play Netflix and other DRM-protected content. My limited little chromebook now had a full-fledged terminal, and a much wider and more capable selection of apps. Filezilla, Firefox, Gimp, LibreOffice, Tor… all just a click away. Just a heads up, this whole procedure left my warranty in the dust. Any time you do anything like pop the lid off and start pulling screws, make sure you do your research WAY before you breakout the toolkit or try breaking open the terminal and start copying and running code that you don’t understand.</p>
<p>But on an opposite, and brighter note, keep exploring and question everything! Happy hacking!</p>

        <p>In July of this year, I purchased a refurbished Acer Chromebook 14. It was my first exposure to Chrome OS and Chromebooks in general. I was a little freaked out by the shipping company used, but once it arrived safely, I was up and running.</p>
<p>I opened the lid for the first time and the computer sprang to life. The Google Chrome logo appeared on a bright white screen.</p>
<img src="/2017/11/26/Chrome-OS-Review-4-Months-Later/chromebook-logo.png">
<h2 id="The-Good"><a href="#The-Good" class="headerlink" title="The Good"></a>The Good</h2><p>Ease of use: 10/10</p>
<p>Chromebooks are one of the easiest things to use, especially if you already have an existing Google account set up. I should also mention, at about 50% screen brightness, this thing can last for nearly 48 hours on battery power.</p>
<p>Speed: 8/10</p>
<p>Just opening the lid is all it takes to boot it up. And the boot time is insane. It felt like the computer was just sleeping, but no. It boots up in what feels like about 5 seconds. Applications are pretty snappy, and surfing the web is a breeze. After all, that’s what Chromebooks are designed for- the web.</p>
<p>Goodies: 7/10</p>
<p>Like with most Google products, once you log in with your credentials, you’ll be prompted to take advantage of a free 100GB made available in your Drive. It almost makes up for the small internal SSD, and I think that’s the idea.</p>
<img src="/2017/11/26/Chrome-OS-Review-4-Months-Later/chromebook-screenshot.jpg">
<h2 id="The-Bad"><a href="#The-Bad" class="headerlink" title="The Bad"></a>The Bad</h2><p>Hardware: 5/10</p>
<p>This is to be expected. With such a small price tag, you can’t expect much on the hardware side. Just enough to be lightweight and mobile, but don’t expect this to be a flat-out gaming machine. The Atom-based Intel quad-core Celeron processor is capable, but quirky. We’ll get to that in a bit. 32GB internal SSD is quick, but small. It’s designed to act as a temporary storage solution until you can get it up to your Google Drive.</p>
<p>Capability: 3/10</p>
<p>This was the deal-breaker for me. The only applications available to download and install are those available in the Google Play Store, and if you haven’t received an OS update for your specific Chromebook model, you may not even have access to Play store apps. So if you can survive with Chrome as your only browser, and the apps available in the Play store, or apps that come in the form of Chrome Extensions, then this shouldn’t be an issue.</p>
<h2 id="The-Verdict"><a href="#The-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="The Verdict:"></a>The Verdict:</h2><p>This just comes down to your personal needs. What do you expect out of your laptop? If you live online and don’t do much else outside of your browser, and you’re okay replacing your copy of MS Office with Google apps, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CVOLVPA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01CVOLVPA&linkCode=as2&tag=mattjones271f-20&linkId=886217b89ce39fd2a6d00b110956e4da" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acer Chromebook 14</a> might be a good choice for you.</p>
<p>If you need to download any applications not offered by Google then you might be out of luck, unless you’re okay installing an Linux distro… then stay tuned. My review of Gallium OS is coming up next!</p>

      </header>
    
    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>I had the opportunity this weekend to produce a few ads for some bamboo bed sheets (Who knew? Clearly not me…) So I felt that was a perfect excuse to start using the latest 2.79 release of Blender. I was completely blown away. Just the fact that 2.79 ships with Filmic, an insane <a href="https://github.com/sobotka/filmic-blender" target="_blank" rel="noopener">addon developed by Troy Sobotka</a> was already enough. It looks amazing. But there’s tons of other great features listed out in a little more detail over at <a href="https://cgcookie.com/articles/blender-2-79-stable-and-rich-in-features" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CG Cookie</a>.</p>

<p>One addition that I’m particularly pumped about is the denoiser that now comes built-in. My scene for this ad campaign was using an HDRI image as the only source of light. The denoiser, on the surface, is a simple checkbox that tells Cycles to go back and clean up tiles that meet certain noise criteria. The default settings worked great for me, but I’ll be eager to play around with various settings under different lighting conditions. Just something to keep in mind, Cycles tends to struggle with small light sources, and can result in lots of ‘fireflies.’ This is different from noise (resulting in inconsistent  pixel brightness), but can often be toned down or prevented entirely if you follow <a href="https://www.blenderguru.com/articles/7-ways-get-rid-fireflies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrew Price’s excellent guide on getting rid of fireflies.</a></p>
<p>Anyway, to the task at hand. I had never heard of bamboo bed sheets (is it just me?) but I figured the client wanted to emphasize the ‘naturalness’ and ‘organic, gluten-free-ness’ of their bed sheets, so I thought, “Why not put a bed in a bamboo forest? That’s kinda cool, right?” So I hopped on over to Blend Swap and found this <a href="https://www.blendswap.com/blends/view/76676" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KILLER model of a bed by Chocofur.</a> I mean, it’s such an excellent model. The topology was excellent (quads), and there was an incredible amount of detail in the top blanket, yet Chocofur managed to keep the polycount way low (less than 200k) which was perfect for what I was going for. They were even generous enough to include some awesome pre-mapped textures as well, so score! Thanks again to Chocofur for providing the hookup.</p>

<p>Next, I needed some bamboo. The results on Blend Swap were kinda sparse, so I took to Google. After a few clicks, I landed on <a href="https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/plant/bush/bamboo-plant-d09970f25bb777b01e93af94c23516fe#tab-description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an incredible model by D. Slomma over on CG Trader.</a> In fact, it was a little too good. After I dropped in the bamboo model, my polycount shot up from 160k to over 2.5M… My machine started to bog down, and selections became super slow. And even worse, this was only one bamboo model. I needed a forest. After 2 or 3 Shift-D duplicating, my polycount broke through the realm of the possible, and Blender crashed. Next I tried using Alt-D to create instances instead, but that still affected the polycount, just like Shift-D.</p>

<p>To fix this, I used a new trick I hadn’t had the opportunity to try yet. Project Linking. Previously, I had always appended models from different project files as needed, but with a heavy poly count, that introduced a problem. The beauty of project linking is that you can bring over anything from an existing project, but it’s not physically copied over. It’s just being referenced in a different location, making your current project a lot more lightweight, and thus, more responsive and crash-free.</p>
<p>From there, I Alt-D duplicated the bamboo model, creating a little forest around the bed. I threw in a plane to use as a floor, and grabbed one of the wooden floor textures I had laying around from previous projects. I ran it through one of my all-time favorite online tools, <a href="http://cpetry.github.io/NormalMap-Online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christian Petry’s browser-based normal map generator.</a> With a single click, I was able to download high quality normal, spec, displace, and bump maps. An absolutely invaluable tool.</p>

<p>Once those textures were plugged into the compositor, my floor was looking pretty good, but I was unsure if the bed should be in a room with lots of potted bamboo around it, or in an actual bamboo forest. The walls around the bed, behind the bamboo seemed very confining, so I ended up grabbing an HDRI map of a forest over at <a href="http://hdrmaps.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hdrmaps.com</a> They’ve got tons of freebies in super high quality EXR files that will do your scene a lot of good. The environment texture came in a bit dark at first, but after increasing the strength, it was a great touch that helped sell the realism of the scene.</p>
<p>Once I took a look at how the forest HDRI looked through the camera, I knew it was perfect. It blended so well with the existing bamboo (which was too short and too identical in the first render) I knew I was only a few tweaks away from my first plate being complete. After adjusting and ‘randomizing’ the bamboo, I threw some plants in front of the lens to give it a little more visual interest, and also to sell the fact that this bed is legit in a bamboo wonderland. Ran in through Photoshop to tweak the colors a bit and add some copy, and that’s pretty much it.</p>
<p>The beauty of this project was its flexibility. I would easily be able to open this project, animate a few camera moves, and come out with an elegant animation fit for virtually any campaign application. Web video, social media, website ad units, or even a commercial production. With high enough quality textures, it’s possible to render out animation in 4k resolution or higher. Even though I lost a good hour our so of screen recording after a computer crash, I’m still pleased with how the final images came out.

        <p>I started 2017 in a pretty low place. I had just recently quit my job due to some crappy corporate politics, and was looking for something new. New as in, a new job, but still in the same field. 100% of my professional experience was in the visual arts fields, specifically video production and motion design. For those of you unfamiliar with that world, it’s fun and I absolutely love it, but work is nontraditional, scarce, and often inconsistent unless you’re based in NYC or LA, then the work is fiercely competitive. I found (and love) my current job on the best nontraditional job-finding site out there: Instagram. School did nothing to prepare me for this career landscape, but that’s another article entirely.</p>
<img src="/2017/11/14/how-i-became-a-professional-developer-in-154-days/jet_scaled.jpeg">
<p>Flash forward a few months, and I’ve never loved a job more. I’m having a blast and I’ve become one of those weird people who actually look forward to Mondays. The only catch is, it’s one of those jobs I don’t do for the money. I do it because I love it, and it’s something I’m passionate about, but my wife is working as often as she can and we can’t clear enough to put our 2 year old in daycare. Freelance video in Tampa, FL is kind of an option, but is so inconsistent, you can’t rely on it, plus I’ve got the upfront cost of gear rentals before I can even charge for services.  So what do I do? Something new. (I’ve allotted on Dr. Seuss line per article, so there you go.)</p>
<p>On June 11, 2017, I took a fantastic leap into a brand new field. I enrolled in one of the zillions of online courses you can take for full stack web development. And even getting to that point wasn’t easy. As an artist, looking at even a snippet of code gave me a gag reflex. So that alone, was a huge barrier. And the fact that it’s called a coding ‘language’ struck all kinds of fear into my heart and soul. I thought learning HTML or JavaScript would be like learning German or Korean.</p>
<img src="/2017/11/14/how-i-became-a-professional-developer-in-154-days/signs_scaled.jpeg">
<p>But after the first few weeks, I started to feel better. I learned the differences between HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the differences between front-end and back-end. Because my course was video-based, it was incredibly helpful to code-along with the instructor and get the same results he was getting. And if I got errors, I could always hit up the chat room for help.</p>
<p>Finally, after several weeks of dedicating one hour to learning code every night, I finally look up from all the tutorial videos and check my progress. 93%. I admit, I was at the point where I was just digging deep and just learning for nights on end with no idea how far away the finish line was. I was getting tired. Forcing myself to learn was tough. But seeing how far I had come… That gave me the last push of motivation I needed to finish. One early morning in September, I finally finished the last tutorial. I got my full stack certification.</p>
<p>I spent the following 2 months continuing to sharpen my new skills, and taking part in the #100DaysOfCode and #codevember challenges as often as I possibly could. I bought another full stack development course just to reinforce the fundamentals I had already learned, and pick up some new things along the way that I the first course didn’t cover like PHP, Python, and MySQL. I used everything I learned in those courses to build my portfolio site (the one you’re looking at right this very second!). I used sites that I had built during my courses as examples of my work, in addition to examples of my existing graphic design and filmmaking skills.</p>
<p>I applied to 3 jobs, but wasn’t ready to fully commit to a ‘real’ job. I wanted to try freelancing and keep my old job to start. So I posted an ad on Facebook Marketplace. I got a lead in 3 hours. I didn’t think much of it, and continued to wait for the work to come rolling in. A week passed by. Nothing. Not a single email, no contacts via my website, not LinkedIn messages, no Facebook messages, nothing. I admit, it was disappointing. But on Saturday, my lead from the week before followed through. I got my first professional development assignment on Sunday.</p>
<p>If an artsy-fartsy type like me can overcome the gag reflex I got just from seeing code… you can learn this stuff too. Started learning and got stuck? Don’t want to deal with it anymore? Give me a shout! I’d be more than happy to take a look at your site. Happy coding!</p>

        <p>First, if you haven’t seen the Netflix Original “The Little Prince”, stop what you’re doing and go watch it. This article will still be here when you get back. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1754656/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Check out The Little Prince on IMDB.</a> One of the opening scenes of the film depicts a single mom so completely absorbed by a corporate mindset that she treats her own child like an adult, and presents her with her “Life Plan.” Every single minute of every day, of every month of the year, meticulously organized on a massive fold-out bulletin board. Sounds ridiculous of course, but the way it’s presented, they paint corporate America to be some dark, ominous, mechanical way of life that everyone must conform to. Which isn’t the case, but that’s a whole other article.</p>
<img src="/2017/11/12/lifePlan/lifePlan.png">
<p>This scene, and the idea of a “Life Plan,” stuck with me for months after first seeing the film. There’s just something about trying to schedule every single little moment of your life… before it ever happens. If you’ve seen the movie, you’ll know that mere moments after the mom introduces the “Life Plan” to her daughter, an airplane propeller rips through their dining room wall, bounces around their house, and smashes into the “Life Plan.”</p>
<p>Regardless, I’ve been on a quest recently to find more free time to put toward writing journal entries, learning to code, coming up with ideas for YouTube videos, writing a novel, or even finding time for a little bit of exercise. And what better way to find the spare minutes of my day-to-day life… than creating my very own “Life Plan”?</p>
<p>Just a note, this is just a tad bit crazy, so when I first did it, I set all my events to ‘private’ so my friends, family, and coworkers couldn’t see that I was actually scheduling things like breakfast and when I should take a shower.<br>I just started at the beginning. When I first wake up, what do I typically do, and about how long does that take? So I started breakfast around 6am, commuting to work around 7am, then working 8am-6pm, then dinner, shower, bed. I left my normal work appointments on my calendar as well, but I just added an all-encompassing “Life Plan” on top of existing calendar items I already had.</p>
<img src="/2017/11/12/lifePlan/schedule_scale.jpg">
<p>Before the “Life Plan”, I would only schedule very important things. Things like meetings for work, or critical deadlines I had to hit. Now that my “Life Plan” blankets my entire calendar, it not only forces me to look at each item and decide if it really is important (or even needs to be there, for that matter), but it also quickly reveals all my spare minutes.</p>
<p>For me, I was able to add 4 hours to my week just by getting up a few minutes earlier on weekday mornings. Before my “Life Plan”, I had a very long to-do list that felt more like a wishlist. Things I wanted to better myself by doing, like writing more and writing more often, or learning a new skill like web development. But all these things fell aside because I “didn’t have time”.<br>Enter “Life Plan”. I’m a former night owl, turned early bird by my wonderful wife who often has to be up well before sunrise for her job. I felt like if I was going to find any time, it’d be earlier rather than later. I decided to dedicate one hour to each of my wishlist items for each weekday. My calendar looked amazing and more colorful than ever.</p>
<p>Enter airplane propeller. My first week of trying to wake up early was a total flop. My one-year-old got sick on Sunday night, delaying my plans to go to bed early, and several hours of interruptions later, I finally went to sleep. I slept through my alarm, and barely made it to work on time. That set my entire week up to follow suit. Things kept coming up that preventing me from adhering to my “Life Plan.”</p>
<p>Week two was better. I was finally able to start dedicating some time to the things I wanted to do. Some items fell through the cracks, but I was starting to get the the hang of it.</p>
<p>I’ve been using my “Life Plan” for 30 days now, and it’s worked in some ways and failed in others. The biggest takeaway for me was learning to prioritize. Some of the items that I thought I wanted to dedicated time to doing turned out to be not that important, so they got replaced. It really cleared up priorities for me and taught me when and how to make time for the important things in life.</p>

        <h2 id="Never-Stop-Learning"><a href="#Never-Stop-Learning" class="headerlink" title="Never Stop Learning"></a>Never Stop Learning</h2><p>Let’s face it. With the speed at which technology changes, you’re never gonna know everything. The minute you graduate, get the job, or feel like you’ve ‘arrived’… News flash: you haven’t. There’s more value in having the ability and willingness to continue learning and roll with ongoing changes than to settle down lock yourself into “This is how I do my thing, and this is how I’ve always done it. Nothing’s ever gonna change that.” If that’s true for you, you’re gonna get left in the dust. Keep learning.</p>
<img src="/2017/11/11/boostCreativity/creative.jpeg">
<h2 id="Push-Yourself"><a href="#Push-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="Push Yourself"></a>Push Yourself</h2><p>It’s great to be genuinely proud of your work. Especially if it’s something that was a result of several days or months of trial and error, trying, failing, and trying again. That’s an awesome feeling, and should totally motivate you every single day. It’s also pretty unrealistic to continuously raise the bar for every single project. You’ll either get burned out or tired of trying to one-up yourself. However, if you set the bar within reason, it’s an awesome tool to continue sharpening your skill set. Definitely continue to strive  to be your best and do the best work you can, but every single thing you touch isn’t going to turn to gold. Instead of looking at everyone else around you and thinking, “I’ll never be on their level.” Just look at your own work and think, “Yeah, typically I’d call it finished at this point, but… what would make this better?” And add a little flare. Keep doing that, and you’ll surprise yourself.</p>
<h2 id="You’re-Not-Perfect"><a href="#You’re-Not-Perfect" class="headerlink" title="You’re Not Perfect"></a>You’re Not Perfect</h2><p>There’s just something about adults and admitting mistakes. No one likes it. But consider the toddlers- when they’re learning to walk and run, they fall all the time. They’re just beginning this whole “walking” thing. They’re inexperienced, but they’re trying. They’re failing here and there, but they don’t stop trying. They don’t fall to the floor, cry and think, “Well, that was a failure. Better quit this and stick to what I know.” They get back up and keep trying, and they don’t care who sees or what anyone else thinks.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as an adult, that attitude leaves us. Somehow we become embarrassed to make mistakes, and think we should just nail it on the first try. Just stick with it, and it’ll pay off. A lot of this can even be applied to the real world and just life in general, not specifically creativity and design.</p>

        <h2 id="Keep-Load-Times-Low"><a href="#Keep-Load-Times-Low" class="headerlink" title="Keep Load Times Low"></a>Keep Load Times Low</h2><p>In today’s fast-paced world, if your site doesn’t load within a few seconds, you’re losing visitors. Even people who don’t have blazing fast connection speeds, or even a limited mobile signal, often still expect decent performance  when it comes to how quickly their website loads. In fact, Google now takes load times into consideration in its page rankings, as talked about briefly in this video:</p>
<div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/OpMfx_Zie2g?t=3m17s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>In fact, according to Google, 53% of mobile users abandon a website if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load.</p>

<h2 id="Bloated-Designs-Can-Do-More-Harm-Than-Good"><a href="#Bloated-Designs-Can-Do-More-Harm-Than-Good" class="headerlink" title="Bloated Designs Can Do More Harm Than Good"></a>Bloated Designs Can Do More Harm Than Good</h2><p>If you’ve had a website for any amount of time, and/or update it frequently, it may seem like an easy choice to just ‘add it to the website’. If you’re constantly making updates, giving announcements, holding sign ups, etc. and you want everyone to see everything right there on the home page, your web design can get bloated quicker than you think! When considering a design, it’s important to be as clean and concise as you can. This may be as simple as choosing what to include (or not) on the homepage or in the menu. This simple idea can also help you in the realm of speedy load times, as well as:</p>
<h2 id="Mobile-Friendliness"><a href="#Mobile-Friendliness" class="headerlink" title="Mobile Friendliness"></a>Mobile Friendliness</h2><img src="/2017/11/10/webDesign/womenWithPhones.jpeg">
<p>This doesn’t necessarily mean make a desktop and mobile version of your site. In fact, it’s best you don’t. I repeat, do not make a mobile version of your site like m.yoursite.com or yoursite.mobi or anything like that. Typically, when you have a dedicated mobile site, you don’t have the same content on your mobile site as your desktop site, and that’s by design. Currently, when Google indexes your site, it ranks your site according to the desktop version. Google does not yet (as of the writing of this article) rank pages based on mobile content. When Google makes the switch to mobile-first indexing, it will take the mobile versions of sites into account when determining the site ranking, which will definitely have an impact on designs that utilize the separate mobile designs. Meanwhile, for users who have implemented a single, completely responsive design… Not much happens! Google will rank your site just the same… be cause it’s the same content. So just a note to keep in mind:</p>

        <p>I’ve been using Blender 3D for various VFX and motion graphics in my career as a filmmaker over the years, but it wasn’t until just recently that I discovered an incredible little plugin called Blend4Web. This amazing little tool allows users to publish their 3D scenes on the web and make them completely interactive. Still learning more, but the future seems pretty bright!</p>
<img src="/2017/11/09/UsingBlenderForWebDesign/400px-Splash_279.png">
<p>I had only heard of Blend4Web a little bit before I actually dove into it and started learning the specifics. After a few days of messing around with Blend4Web, there are a handful of features I feel I should point out. Coming from a design and 3D heavy background, my biggest question was, “Should I dive into Blend4Web and use it as a part of my normal 3D workflow as I transition into web? Or, since I’m already learning JavaScript, would it be worth my time to learn <a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three.js</a> instead?”</p>
<p>Well, after a day of messing around with Blend4Web, I can already tell that the learning curve is STEEP. Blend4Web is an insanely large application, and that’s great. It even comes with its own dedicated rendering engine, which blows my mind. But in order to get the same or similar results out of Blend4Web, you have to learn an entirely new rendering engine, that has its own set of limitations and capabilities, which takes a ton of time to get decent results coming from my comfort zone of Cycles.</p>
<p>Just grasping the basic of converting cycles environment maps to cube maps (and made easy thanks to this clever plugin!) Looking forward to learning more, but here’s a quick timelapse of how it looks:</p>

<p>If you’re up to the challenge, and are already intimately familiar with Blender and all its nuances, I’d say go for it. But I consider myself a pretty avid Blender user for 5+ years and it’s still intimidating.</p>
<p>If I had to choose a path, I’d probably use Blender for modeling, kick out the .obj files, and bring those into my web app using three.js. Just based on my experience, three.js apps just seem to run a lot more quickly in the browser.</p>
